# rp_downtown_gigatits VMF
The Low Sodium Map, rp_downtown_gigatits

# Good Faith
This VMF is released in good faith that you, in the future, will release your own version to the public, source and compile.
The history of Downtown is built upon the work of every mapper that came before you, for over 10 years, this map has been edited
to its very core, and not all of them were the best, this map is dense, and pushes the engine to its very core.

But at the end of the day, the spirit of it should live on. The license provided in this repository requires that
you release any derivative source of the map to the public, however that may be. So that other ambitious people
that come after you, may build upon your work too. Just as everyone that came before you did.

# Previously

This version is significantly different from tits_v2, and was built on top of fudgy_t6, but most changes from fudgy_t6 are gone.
It is closer to tits_v2 than fudgy_t6.

Best used with Hammer++.
